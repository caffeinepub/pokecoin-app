  "summary": "The implementation fully addresses all four requirements (REQ-1 through REQ-4) with complete backend and frontend functionality for Pokecoin tracking, shiny female Pokemon management, payout tracking, and Pokemon-themed UI design. However, the implementation lacks balance history functionality required by REQ-1's acceptance criteria.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Users can view their Pokecoin balance history",
      "reason": "The backend only stores and returns the current balance (single Nat value per user), not a history of balance changes over time. The viewPokecoinBalance function returns a single balance value, and logPokecoinBalance overwrites rather than appending to history.",

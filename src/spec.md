# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a Pokecoin tracking app with shiny female Pokemon finder that allows Pokemon Go players to track their Pokecoin balance, Google Play payouts, and shiny female Pokemon collection.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a Pokecoin balance tracking system where users can log and view their current Pokecoin balance
- Implement a shiny female Pokemon tracker for logging and searching shiny female Pokemon encounters
- Build a payout management system to track Google Play payout amounts linked to Pokecoin earnings
- Design a Pokemon-themed UI with vibrant colors, playful typography, and card-based layouts

**User-visible outcome:** Users can track their Pokecoin balance history, manage their shiny female Pokemon collection (marking them as found or desired), record Google Play payouts with cumulative totals, all within a cohesive Pokemon-themed interface.
